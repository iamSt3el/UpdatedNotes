- [ ] Valid Anagram (Hash table)

### Weekly Schedule
- [ ] Monday: Study new pattern
- [ ] Tuesday-Wednesday: Solve related easy problems
- [ ] Thursday: Learn pattern variations
- [ ] Friday-Sunday: Tackle medium difficulty problems

## Daily Routine
- [ ] Solve 1 easy problem
- [ ] Learn 1 new concept
- [ ] Solve 1 medium problem using that concept
- [ ] Review a previous difficult problem
## Problem-Solving Approach
1. Read problem (5 mins)
2. Try solving with current knowledge (10-15 mins)
3. If stuck:
   - [ ] Look for hints
   - [ ] Identify potential concepts
   - [ ] Draw the problem
4. If still stuck after 30 mins:
   - [ ] Read solution
   - [ ] Understand approach
   - [ ] Close solution
   - [ ] Code it yourself
