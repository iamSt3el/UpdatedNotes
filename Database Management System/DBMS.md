# Database Management Systems - Comprehensive Notes

## Introduction to Databases and RDBMS

### What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet where information is stored in a structured way that makes it easy to find and use.

Imagine you have a collection of books. Without any organization, finding a specific book would require looking through every book until you find the one you want. But if you organize them by author, title, or genre, finding a specific book becomes much easier. A database works in a similar way but for digital information.

### Why Do We Need Databases?

Before databases, data was typically stored in file systems, which had several limitations:

- **Data redundancy**: The same information might be stored in multiple files
- **Data inconsistency**: The same information might be stored differently in different files
- **Difficult access**: Retrieving specific information required custom programs
- **Limited data sharing**: Multiple users couldn't easily access the same data
- **Integrity problems**: Maintaining rules about the data was difficult

Databases solve these problems by providing a central repository for data with rules about how the data is organized and accessed.

### Types of Databases

There are several types of databases, each designed for specific purposes:

1. **Relational Databases**: Store data in tables with rows and columns (most common)
2. **NoSQL Databases**: Store data in formats other than tables (documents, key-value pairs, graphs)
3. **Object-oriented Databases**: Store data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming
4. **Hierarchical Databases**: Store data in a tree-like structure
5. **Network Databases**: Store data with records connected through links

### What is RDBMS?

A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is software that:

- Allows you to implement a relational database (tables with rows and columns)
- Provides tools for creating, maintaining, and using the database
- Ensures data integrity and security
- Manages concurrent access to data by multiple users
- Provides backup and recovery mechanisms

Popular RDBMS examples include:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite

### The Relational Model

The relational model, developed by E.F. Codd in 1970, is the theoretical foundation of relational databases. It represents data as collections of tables (called "relations") where:

- Each table has a unique name
- Each row (called a "tuple") represents one entity or relationship
- Each column (called an "attribute") represents one property of the entity
- Each cell contains exactly one value

Here's a simple example of a relational table representing students:

|StudentID|FirstName|LastName|BirthDate|Major|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1001|John|Smith|2000-05-15|Computer Science|
|1002|Maria|Garcia|2001-02-23|Biology|
|1003|Ahmed|Hassan|1999-11-07|Mathematics|

The power of the relational model comes from its ability to establish relationships between tables, which we'll explore further when we discuss database keys.

## Data Definitions: Tables, Fields, Records

### Tables

A table is the basic unit of data storage in a relational database. Each table represents a single entity type (like students, courses, or products). Tables are also called "relations" in formal relational theory.

Think of a table like a spreadsheet with rows and columns, but with stricter rules:

- All data in a column must be of the same type
- Each column has a name (called a field or attribute)
- The order of columns doesn't matter
- Each row should be unique
- The order of rows doesn't matter

### Fields (Columns)

Fields are the vertical columns in a table. Each field represents one attribute of the entity that the table represents.

For example, in a `Customers` table, you might have fields like:

- CustomerID
- FirstName
- LastName
- Email
- Phone
- Address

Each field has several properties:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the field within the table
- **Data Type**: The kind of data the field can store (text, numbers, dates, etc.)
- **Size/Length**: The maximum amount of data the field can store
- **Constraints**: Rules about what values are allowed (e.g., not null, unique)
- **Default Value**: The value used if no value is specified

### Records (Rows)

Records are the horizontal rows in a table. Each record represents one specific instance of the entity type that the table represents.

For example, in the `Customers` table, each row would represent one specific customer with all their attributes.

### Creating a Table: Example

Here's how you might create a simple `Products` table in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    InStock BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    DateAdded DATE
);
```

This creates a table with:

- Six fields (ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, InStock, DateAdded)
- Different data types for each field
- A primary key (ProductID)
- A NOT NULL constraint on ProductName and Price
- A default value for InStock

### Schema

A schema is the structure that defines how data is organized in a database. It includes:

- The tables in the database
- The fields in each table
- The relationships between tables
- Constraints and rules that apply to the data

Think of a schema as the blueprint for your database. It doesn't contain the actual data, but it defines how the data will be stored.

## SQL and Data Manipulation

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. Despite its name, SQL isn't just for queriesâ€”it's a complete language for:

- Creating, altering, and deleting database structures (DDL: Data Definition Language)
- Adding, updating, and removing data (DML: Data Manipulation Language)
- Controlling access to the database (DCL: Data Control Language)
- Managing transactions (TCL: Transaction Control Language)

SQL is declarative, which means you specify WHAT you want, not HOW to get it. The database engine figures out the most efficient way to execute your command.

### Basic SQL Syntax

SQL commands are written as statements that end with a semicolon (;). SQL is not case-sensitive for keywords, but it's common practice to write SQL keywords in UPPERCASE to distinguish them from table and column names.

For example:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Students WHERE Major = 'Computer Science';
```

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of database objects.

#### CREATE

Used to create database objects like tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    HireDate DATE
);
```

#### ALTER

Used to modify existing database objects:

```sql
-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

-- Change a column's data type
ALTER TABLE Employees ALTER COLUMN Department VARCHAR(100);

-- Add a constraint
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Salary CHECK (Salary > 0);
```

#### DROP

Used to delete database objects:

```sql
-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE Employees;

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN Email;
```

#### TRUNCATE

Used to remove all records from a table without deleting the table structure:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate the data within database objects.

#### INSERT

Used to add new records to a table:

```sql
-- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary, HireDate)
VALUES (1001, 'John', 'Smith', 'IT', 75000, '2022-03-15');

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary, HireDate)
VALUES 
    (1002, 'Maria', 'Garcia', 'HR', 65000, '2021-06-10'),
    (1003, 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'Finance', 80000, '2022-01-05');
```

#### SELECT

Used to retrieve data from one or more tables:

```sql
-- Select all columns and all rows
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees;

-- Filter rows with a WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Sort results
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Group and aggregate data
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

#### UPDATE

Used to modify existing records:

```sql
-- Update all records
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.05;

-- Update specific records
UPDATE Employees SET Department = 'Information Technology' WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

#### DELETE

Used to remove records from a table:

```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Finance';

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM Employees;
```

### Querying Multiple Tables: Joins

One of the most powerful features of SQL is the ability to combine data from multiple tables using joins.

#### INNER JOIN

Returns records that have matching values in both tables:

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentID;
```

#### LEFT JOIN

Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table:

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, p.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID;
```

#### RIGHT JOIN

Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table:

```sql
SELECT p.ProjectName, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Projects p
RIGHT JOIN Employees e ON p.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID;
```

#### FULL JOIN

Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table:

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, p.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
FULL JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID;
```

### SQL Functions

SQL includes many built-in functions for performing calculations and transformations:

#### Aggregate Functions

- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows
- `SUM()`: Calculates the sum of values
- `AVG()`: Calculates the average of values
- `MIN()`: Finds the minimum value
- `MAX()`: Finds the maximum value

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary,
    MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary,
    MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

#### String Functions

- `CONCAT()`: Combines strings
- `UPPER()`: Converts to uppercase
- `LOWER()`: Converts to lowercase
- `SUBSTRING()`: Extracts part of a string
- `LENGTH()`: Returns the length of a string

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
    UPPER(Department) AS Department
FROM Employees;
```

#### Date Functions

- `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time
- `YEAR()`: Extracts the year from a date
- `MONTH()`: Extracts the month from a date
- `DAY()`: Extracts the day from a date
- `DATEDIFF()`: Calculates the difference between two dates

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsEmployed
FROM Employees;
```

## Database Keys and Data Integrity

Database keys are crucial for organizing data and establishing relationships between tables. They also help enforce data integrity.

### Types of Keys

#### Primary Key

A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Primary keys must be:

- Unique (no duplicate values)
- Not null (must always have a value)
- Unchanging (values shouldn't be modified)

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- This is the primary key
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

A primary key can also consist of multiple columns (called a composite primary key):

```sql
CREATE TABLE CourseEnrollments (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    Grade CHAR(1),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)  -- Composite primary key
);
```

#### Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column or combination of columns that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys:

- Create relationships between tables
- Enforce referential integrity (ensuring related records exist)
- Can be null (if the relationship is optional)

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

In this example, the `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key that references the `CustomerID` primary key in the `Customers` table.

#### Candidate Key

A candidate key is a column or combination of columns that could potentially be used as a primary key. Every table has at least one candidate key (which becomes the primary key).

For example, in a `Students` table, both `StudentID` and `Email` might be candidate keys since both can uniquely identify a student.

#### Alternate Key

An alternate key is a candidate key that is not selected as the primary key. In the example above, if we choose `StudentID` as the primary key, then `Email` becomes an alternate key.

#### Composite Key

A composite key is a key that consists of two or more columns. It can be a primary key, foreign key, or candidate key.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE BookAuthors (
    ISBN VARCHAR(13),
    AuthorID INT,
    Role VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (ISBN, AuthorID)  -- Composite primary key
);
```

#### Surrogate Key

A surrogate key is an artificial key created solely to act as a primary key. It typically has no business meaning.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Surrogate key
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    SKU VARCHAR(20),  -- Natural key
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

In this example, `ProductID` is a surrogate key automatically generated by the database, while `SKU` is a natural key with business meaning.

### Data Integrity

Data integrity ensures that data in a database is accurate, consistent, and reliable. There are several types of data integrity:

#### Entity Integrity

Entity integrity ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identified by its primary key. This means:

- The primary key cannot be null
- The primary key must be unique

Entity integrity is enforced by primary key constraints.

#### Referential Integrity

Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. This means:

- A foreign key must either match a primary key in the referenced table or be null
- You cannot delete a primary key value if it is referenced by foreign keys in other tables

Referential integrity is enforced by foreign key constraints, which can specify actions to take when a referenced record is deleted or updated:

- `CASCADE`: Automatically delete or update related records
- `SET NULL`: Set the foreign key to NULL
- `SET DEFAULT`: Set the foreign key to its default value
- `RESTRICT` or `NO ACTION`: Prevent the deletion or update

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

#### Domain Integrity

Domain integrity ensures that all values in a column fall within the defined domain (set of allowable values). This is enforced by:

- Data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE)
- NOT NULL constraints
- CHECK constraints
- DEFAULT values
- UNIQUE constraints

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0),
    Category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Uncategorized',
    SKU VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
);
```

### Constraints

Constraints are rules enforced on the data columns in tables. They limit the type of data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted. Common constraints include:

#### NOT NULL

Ensures a column cannot have NULL values:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### UNIQUE

Ensures all values in a column are different:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

#### CHECK

Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    BirthDate DATE CHECK (BirthDate > '1900-01-01'),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary >= 0)
);
```

#### DEFAULT

Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
);
```

## Normalization in DBMS

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

### Why Normalize?

Unnormalized databases often suffer from:

- **Data redundancy**: The same data is stored in multiple places
- **Update anomalies**: If data exists in multiple places, updates must be made in all places
- **Insertion anomalies**: Unable to add certain data because other unrelated data doesn't exist yet
- **Deletion anomalies**: Deleting some data unintentionally deletes other important data

### Normal Forms

Normalization is achieved through applying a series of rules called "normal forms." Each normal form builds on the previous one, addressing more specific aspects of database design.

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

A table is in 1NF if:

- It has no repeating groups or arrays
- All column values are atomic (indivisible)

Example of a table NOT in 1NF:

|StudentID|Name|Courses|
|---|---|---|
|1|John Smith|Math, History, Physics|
|2|Maria Garcia|English, Biology|

To convert to 1NF, we'd separate the courses:

|StudentID|Name|Course|
|---|---|---|
|1|John Smith|Math|
|1|John Smith|History|
|1|John Smith|Physics|
|2|Maria Garcia|English|
|2|Maria Garcia|Biology|

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

A table is in 2NF if:

- It is in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key (not just part of it)

This mainly applies to tables with composite primary keys.

Example of a table NOT in 2NF:

|StudentID|CourseID|CourseName|Instructor|Grade|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|C1|Algebra|Dr. Johnson|A|
|1|C2|History|Dr. Smith|B|
|2|C1|Algebra|Dr. Johnson|C|

In this table, (StudentID, CourseID) is the primary key. The problem is that CourseName and Instructor depend only on CourseID, not on the entire primary key.

To convert to 2NF, we'd create separate tables:

Students_Courses:

|StudentID|CourseID|Grade|
|---|---|---|
|1|C1|A|
|1|C2|B|
|2|C1|C|

Courses:

|CourseID|CourseName|Instructor|
|---|---|---|
|C1|Algebra|Dr. Johnson|
|C2|History|Dr. Smith|

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in 3NF if:

- It is in 2NF
- All non-key attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key (they depend directly on the primary key, not through another attribute)

Example of a table NOT in 3NF:

|EmployeeID|Department|DepartmentLocation|
|---|---|---|
|1|IT|Building A|
|2|HR|Building B|
|3|IT|Building A|

In this table, DepartmentLocation depends on Department, which depends on EmployeeID. This is a transitive dependency.

To convert to 3NF, we'd create separate tables:

Employees:

|EmployeeID|Department|
|---|---|
|1|IT|
|2|HR|
|3|IT|

Departments:

|Department|DepartmentLocation|
|---|---|
|IT|Building A|
|HR|Building B|

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A table is in BCNF if:

- It is in 3NF
- For every functional dependency X â†’ Y, X is a superkey (a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row)

BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF that addresses some rare cases where 3NF isn't sufficient.

#### Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

These advanced normal forms deal with multi-valued dependencies and join dependencies. They're less commonly used in practical database design but are important in specific complex scenarios.

### Denormalization

Sometimes, after normalizing a database, you might deliberately reintroduce some redundancy to improve performance. This is called denormalization.

Reasons for denormalization:

- Reducing the number of joins needed for common queries
- Improving query performance
- Simplifying reporting

However, denormalization comes at the cost of increased storage and potential data inconsistency.

## Transaction Management in DBMS

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A database transaction must maintain ACID properties.

### ACID Properties

#### Atomicity

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.

Example: If a bank transfer involves debiting one account and crediting another, either both operations should succeed or both should fail. You don't want to debit one account without crediting the other.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Debit account 1
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2; -- Credit account 2
COMMIT;
```

If any error occurs during the transaction, you can roll back all changes:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
    -- If an error occurs:
    ROLLBACK;  -- This undoes the debit operation
```

#### Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints.

For example, if a rule states that account balances can't be negative, a transaction should not violate this rule:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Check if there are sufficient funds
    DECLARE @Balance DECIMAL;
    SELECT @Balance = Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
    
    IF @Balance >= 100
    BEGIN
        UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
        UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
        COMMIT;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK;
    END
```

#### Isolation

Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction should appear to execute in isolation from other transactions.

Without proper isolation, several problems can occur:

- **Dirty reads**: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction
- **Non-repeatable reads**: Reading the same row twice and getting different results
- **Phantom reads**: A transaction re-executes a query and finds rows that weren't there before

Isolation levels determine the degree of isolation:

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Prevents all concurrency issues

Example:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Operations
COMMIT;
```

#### Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes remain permanent even in the event of a system failure.

This is typically implemented using:

- **Transaction logs**: Records all changes made by transactions
- **Checkpoints**: Periodically synchronizes the database with the transaction log
- **Recovery systems**: Restores the database to a consistent state after a failure

### Transaction Control Commands

SQL provides several commands for controlling transactions:

#### BEGIN TRANSACTION

Marks the starting point of a transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

#### COMMIT

Saves all changes made during the transaction and ends the transaction:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

#### ROLLBACK

Undoes all changes made during the transaction and ends the transaction:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

#### SAVEPOINT

Creates a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back:

```sql
SAVEPOINT SavepointName;
```

#### ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT

Rolls back a transaction to a savepoint without ending the transaction:

```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT SavepointName;
```

### Concurrency Control

Concurrency control techniques prevent simultaneous access to the same data from causing problems.

#### Locking

Locking prevents multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously:

- **Shared locks**: Allow multiple transactions to read the same data
- **Exclusive locks**: Allow only one transaction to modify the data

Example:

```sql
-- Acquire an exclusive lock on a table
LOCK TABLE Accounts IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Operations

-- Release locks
COMMIT;
```

#### Optimistic Concurrency Control

Instead of locking data preemptively, optimistic concurrency control checks for conflicts at commit time:

1. When a transaction starts, record the current state
2. When it's time to commit, check if the state has changed
3. If it has changed, abort and retry the transaction

This is often implemented using version numbers or timestamps:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    DECLARE @Version INT;
    SELECT @Version = Version FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
    
    -- Operations
    
    -- Check if the version is still the same
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1 AND Version = @Version)
    BEGIN
        UPDATE Accounts 
        SET Balance = Balance - 100, Version = Version + 1 
        WHERE AccountID = 1 AND Version = @Version;
        
        -- Other operations
        
        COMMIT;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK;
        -- Retry or handle the conflict
    END
```

### Deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, creating a circular dependency.

For example:

1. Transaction A locks resource X and wants resource Y
2. Transaction B locks resource Y and wants resource X
3. Both transactions wait indefinitely

Most DBMSs detect deadlocks and automatically terminate one transaction to allow the other to proceed.

To prevent deadlocks:

- Always access resources in the same order
- Keep transactions short and simple
- Use appropriate isolation levels
- Set deadlock timeouts

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

Two-Phase Commit is a protocol for ensuring that a transaction is committed across multiple database systems:

1. **Prepare phase**: The coordinator asks all participants if they're ready to commit
2. **Commit phase**: If all participants agree to commit, the coordinator tells them to commit

This ensures atomicity across distributed systems.

## Practical Database Design Process

Now that we've covered the theoretical aspects of database management, let's walk through a practical example of designing a database for a simple library management system.

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis

First, determine what information needs to be stored and what operations need to be performed:

- The library has books, authors, members, and loans
- Books can have multiple authors
- Members can borrow multiple books
- Each loan has a due date and a return date

### Step 2: Conceptual Design

Create an entity-relationship (ER) diagram to visualize the entities and their relationships:

- **Entities**: Books, Authors, Members, Loans
- **Relationships**:
    - Books and Authors have a many-to-many relationship
    - Members and Books have a many-to-many relationship through Loans
    - Each Loan connects one Member to one Book

### Step 3: Logical Design

Transform the ER diagram into a relational schema:

1. **Books**:
    
    - BookID (PK)
    - Title
    - ISBN
    - PublicationYear
    - Publisher
    - Category
2. **Authors**:
    
    - AuthorID (PK)
    - FirstName
    - LastName
    - BirthYear
3. **BookAuthors** (resolving the many-to-many relationship):
    
    - BookID (PK, FK)
    - AuthorID (PK, FK)
4. **Members**:
    
    - MemberID (PK)
    - FirstName
    - LastName
    - Email
    - Phone
    - JoinDate
5. **Loans**:
    
    - LoanID (PK)
    - BookID (FK)
    - MemberID (FK)
    - LoanDate
    - DueDate
    - ReturnDate

### Step 4: Physical Design

Implement the database using SQL:

```sql
-- Create Books table
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    ISBN VARCHAR(13) UNIQUE,
    PublicationYear INT,
    Publisher VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Authors table
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    BirthYear INT
);

-- Create BookAuthors table
CREATE TABLE BookAuthors (
    BookID INT,
    AuthorID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (BookID, AuthorID),
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),
    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID)
);

-- Create Members table
CREATE TABLE Members (
    MemberID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    JoinDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Create Loans table
CREATE TABLE Loans (
    LoanID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    BookID INT,
    MemberID INT,
    LoanDate DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    DueDate DATE NOT NULL,
    ReturnDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),
    FOREIGN KEY (MemberID) REFERENCES Members(MemberID),
    CHECK (ReturnDate IS NULL OR ReturnDate >= LoanDate)
);
```

### Step 5: Adding Sample Data

```sql
-- Insert sample books
INSERT INTO Books (BookID, Title, ISBN, PublicationYear, Publisher, Category)
VALUES 
(1, 'Database Systems: The Complete Book', '9780131873254', 2008, 'Pearson', 'Computer Science'),
(2, 'The Lord of the Rings', '9780618640157', 1954, 'Houghton Mifflin', 'Fantasy'),
(3, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', '9780061120084', 1960, 'HarperCollins', 'Fiction'),
(4, 'The Great Gatsby', '9780743273565', 1925, 'Scribner', 'Fiction');

-- Insert sample authors
INSERT INTO Authors (AuthorID, FirstName, LastName, BirthYear)
VALUES 
(1, 'Hector', 'Garcia-Molina', 1954),
(2, 'Jeffrey', 'Ullman', 1942),
(3, 'Jennifer', 'Widom', 1960),
(4, 'J.R.R.', 'Tolkien', 1892),
(5, 'Harper', 'Lee', 1926),
(6, 'F. Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 1896);

-- Link books and authors
INSERT INTO BookAuthors (BookID, AuthorID)
VALUES 
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),  -- Database Systems has 3 authors
(2, 4),                  -- The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien
(3, 5),                  -- To Kill a Mockingbird by Lee
(4, 6);                  -- The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald

-- Insert sample members
INSERT INTO Members (MemberID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, JoinDate)
VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'alice@email.com', '555-1234', '2023-01-15'),
(2, 'Bob', 'Smith', 'bob@email.com', '555-5678', '2023-02-20'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'charlie@email.com', '555-9012', '2023-03-25');

-- Insert sample loans
INSERT INTO Loans (LoanID, BookID, MemberID, LoanDate, DueDate, ReturnDate)
VALUES 
(1, 1, 1, '2023-06-01', '2023-06-15', '2023-06-14'),  -- Returned on time
(2, 2, 1, '2023-06-16', '2023-06-30', NULL),          -- Not yet returned
(3, 3, 2, '2023-06-10', '2023-06-24', '2023-06-23'),  -- Returned on time
(4, 4, 3, '2023-06-05', '2023-06-19', '2023-06-25');  -- Returned late
```

### Step 6: Sample Queries

Now let's write some SQL queries to perform common operations on our library database:

#### Find all books by a specific author:

```sql
SELECT b.Title, b.ISBN, b.PublicationYear
FROM Books b
JOIN BookAuthors ba ON b.BookID = ba.BookID
JOIN Authors a ON ba.AuthorID = a.AuthorID
WHERE a.LastName = 'Tolkien';
```

#### Find all overdue books and their borrowers:

```sql
SELECT m.FirstName, m.LastName, m.Email, b.Title, l.DueDate,
       DATEDIFF(day, l.DueDate, GETDATE()) AS DaysOverdue
FROM Loans l
JOIN Books b ON l.BookID = b.BookID
JOIN Members m ON l.MemberID = m.MemberID
WHERE l.ReturnDate IS NULL AND l.DueDate < GETDATE()
ORDER BY DaysOverdue DESC;
```

#### Find the most popular books (most frequently borrowed):

```sql
SELECT b.Title, COUNT(l.LoanID) AS TimesLoaned
FROM Books b
LEFT JOIN Loans l ON b.BookID = l.BookID
GROUP BY b.Title
ORDER BY TimesLoaned DESC;
```

#### Calculate the average loan duration:

```sql
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(day, LoanDate, COALESCE(ReturnDate, GETDATE()))) AS AvgLoanDays
FROM Loans;
```

#### List all members with currently borrowed books:

```sql
SELECT m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName, 
       COUNT(l.LoanID) AS BooksCurrentlyBorrowed
FROM Members m
JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
WHERE l.ReturnDate IS NULL
GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName;
```

## Summary and Best Practices

### Database Design Best Practices

1. **Start with requirements**: Understand what data you need to store and what operations you'll perform on it.
    
2. **Normalize appropriately**: Use normalization to reduce redundancy, but consider performance needs for read-heavy systems.
    
3. **Choose appropriate data types**: Use the most appropriate data type for each field to save space and improve performance.
    
4. **Use meaningful names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for tables and columns.
    
5. **Implement constraints**: Use primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to maintain data integrity.
    
6. **Document your design**: Create documentation that explains your database structure, relationships, and constraints.
    
7. **Plan for growth**: Design your database to accommodate future growth in data volume and additional requirements.
    
8. **Consider indexing**: Add indexes to columns frequently used in WHERE clauses and joins to improve query performance.
    
9. **Secure your database**: Implement appropriate access controls, encryption, and auditing.
    
10. **Test thoroughly**: Test your database design with realistic data volumes and query patterns.
