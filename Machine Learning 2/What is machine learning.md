## Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms I: Notes

**1. Introduction to Unsupervised Learning:**

* Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from data without explicit labels or target outputs.
* The goal is to discover underlying structure, relationships, and groupings within the data.
* Common tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
* Differs from supervised learning, which uses labeled data to predict outcomes.

**2. What is Clustering?**

* Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together into clusters.
* The goal is to maximize similarity within clusters and minimize similarity between clusters.
* Applications include customer segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and document analysis.
* Various clustering algorithms exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

**3. K-means Intuition:**

* K-means is a popular partitioning clustering algorithm.
* Aims to partition *n* observations into *k* clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid).
* Iteratively refines cluster assignments and centroids until convergence.
* Intuitively, it tries to find *k* representative points that best summarize the data.

**4. K-means Algorithm:**

1. **Initialization:** Randomly select *k* initial centroids.
2. **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the closest centroid based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
3. **Update:** Recalculate the centroids by averaging the data points assigned to each cluster.
4. **Repeat:** Iterate steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

**5. Optimization Objective:**

* K-means aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), also known as inertia.
* WCSS measures the total squared distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.
* Lower WCSS indicates better clustering, with data points closer to their respective centroids.

**6. Initializing K-means:**

* Random initialization can lead to different results and suboptimal solutions.
* **K-means++:** A more sophisticated initialization method that spreads the initial centroids out more effectively, often leading to better convergence.  It selects centroids probabilistically, favoring points farther from existing centroids.
* Other methods include Forgy and Random Partition.

**7. Choosing the Number of Clusters (k):**

* Determining the optimal *k* is crucial for effective clustering.
* **Elbow Method:** Plot WCSS against different values of *k*. The "elbow" point in the plot, where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly, suggests a good value for *k*.
* **Silhouette Analysis:** Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher average silhouette scores indicate better clustering.
* **Gap Statistic:** Compares the WCSS of the observed data to the WCSS of randomly generated data.

**8. Hard versus Soft Clustering:**

* **Hard Clustering:** Each data point belongs to exactly one cluster. K-means is an example of hard clustering.
* **Soft Clustering:**  Also known as fuzzy clustering. Each data point has a probability or degree of membership to each cluster.  Algorithms like Fuzzy C-means allow for overlapping clusters.

**9. Using the Elbow Method to Find the Optimal Number of Clusters:**

1. Run K-means for different values of *k* (e.g., *k* = 2 to 10).
2. Calculate the WCSS for each *k*.
3. Plot WCSS against *k*.
4. Identify the "elbow" point in the plot.  This point represents a good trade-off between minimizing WCSS and avoiding overfitting (too many clusters).
