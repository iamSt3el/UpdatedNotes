- An on-demand delivery of servers, storage, database, applications and other IT resources as service over the internet.
- Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

## Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- **On-demand Self Service**
- **Broad network access**
- **Resource pooling**
- **Rapid Elasticity**
- **Measured Service**

| Cloud infrastructure is provisioned for the general public to use.                                      | For exclusive use by a single organization with multiple consumers                            | A combination of public and private cloud modles                                                                                        |
| Exists on the premised of the CSP                                                                       | Infrastructure is owned and managed by the organization on premise                            | Harder management, but allow better alignment to business needs                                                                         |
| Consumers use the cloud service offered by the providers via the internet and pay metered usage charges | Require in-house IT skills and expertise                                                      | e.g. an organization with its own data center facility may choose to utilize the services of a public cloud for inexpensive data backup |
| Most const-effective through multitenancy, enormous scalability                                         | Better control over data location and security, but limited scalability                       |                                                                                                                                         |

## Cloud Service Models

#### SaaS(Software as a Service):
- Provision of ready-to-use applications hosted in the cloud for end-users and organizations
- For e.g, Salesforce Customer Relationship Management(CRM), Microsoft Office 365

#### PaaS(Platform as a Service):
- Provision of a software platform (programming languages, libraries, service and tools) for application developers to quickly create and deploy custom applications
- For e.g., Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine

#### IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service):
- Provision of processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources for use by system administrators(IT Operations)
- For e.g., Amazon ElasticCompute Cloud(EC2)
